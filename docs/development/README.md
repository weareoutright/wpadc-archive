This directory contains technical documentation to support ongoing development of the WPA DC Archive.

## Structure

### `/time-analyses/`
Feature development time studies, effort estimates, and completion analyses.

### `/decisions/`
Technical Decision Records (ADRs) documenting important development choices and their rationale.

### `/guides/`
Development guides, best practices, and how-to documentation for team members.

## Purpose

Provide developers with the context, decisions, and guidance needed to contribute effectively to the project.

## Document Types

- **Time Analyses**: Development effort breakdowns and completion estimates
- **Technical Decisions**: Formal records of technology choices and trade-offs
- **Development Guides**: Setup instructions, coding standards, and workflows
- **Code Reviews**: Notable code review findings and improvements
- **Performance Analyses**: Optimization studies and benchmark results

## When to Add Documents

- After significant feature development to capture lessons learned
- When making important technical decisions that affect future development
- When establishing new development practices or standards
- When documenting complex implementation details
