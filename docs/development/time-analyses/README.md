# Time Analyses

This directory contains feature development time studies and effort estimates for the WPA DC Archive project.

## Purpose

Track and analyze development effort to improve project planning, estimation accuracy, and resource allocation decisions.

## Document Types

- **Feature Completion Analyses**: Comprehensive reviews of development work including time invested and remaining effort
- **Effort Estimates**: Detailed breakdowns of expected development time for planned features
- **Retrospective Time Studies**: Post-completion analysis of actual vs. estimated development time
- **Collaboration Efficiency Studies**: Analysis of different development approaches and their time implications

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames that indicate the feature or analysis scope:
- `[feature-name]-analysis.md` for comprehensive feature studies
- `[feature-name]-estimate.md` for planning estimates
- `[feature-name]-retrospective.md` for post-completion reviews

## When to Add Documents

- When planning significant new features
- After completing substantial development work
- When analyzing development efficiency and collaboration models
- Before making resource allocation decisions
