# Technical Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Technical Decision Records documenting important technical choices made during the development of the WPA DC Archive.

## Purpose

Capture the context, options considered, and rationale behind significant technical decisions to help future developers understand why certain approaches were chosen.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Expected positive and negative outcomes

## Document Types

- **Technology Choices**: Framework selections, library decisions
- **Architecture Decisions**: Structural and design pattern choices
- **Development Process**: Workflow and methodology decisions
- **Integration Decisions**: Third-party service and API choices

## Naming Convention

Use numbered ADRs with descriptive titles:
- `001-nextjs-framework-choice.md`
- `002-apollo-client-state-management.md`
- `003-wordpress-headless-architecture.md`

## When to Add ADRs

- When choosing between multiple viable technical options
- When making decisions that will be hard to reverse later
- When establishing new development patterns or practices
- When significant trade-offs are involved in the decision
