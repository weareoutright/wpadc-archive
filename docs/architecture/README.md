# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains system design documents and architectural decision records for the WPA DC Archive.

## Purpose

Document high-level system architecture, design patterns, and structural decisions that guide the development of the application.

## Document Types

- **System Architecture**: Overall application structure and component relationships
- **Data Models**: Database schema and content type definitions
- **API Design**: GraphQL schema and endpoint documentation
- **Component Architecture**: React component hierarchy and design patterns
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment architecture and hosting decisions

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames that indicate the architectural area:
- `component-hierarchy.md`
- `graphql-schema-design.md`
- `wordpress-integration-architecture.md`

## When to Add Documents

- When making significant architectural changes
- When establishing new design patterns
- When documenting infrastructure decisions
- When defining system boundaries and integrations
